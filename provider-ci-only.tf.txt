# azurerm v2 had a great idea to make features mandatory
# but then modules need to have it
# but modules aren't supposed to define a provider
# so we have this hack (CI renames this while running)
# if anyone finds a better solution pls remove and let me know

provider "azurerm" { 
    features {} 
}
